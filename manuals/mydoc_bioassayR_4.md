As mentioned in the above examples, a pre-built database containing large 
quantities of public domain bioactivity data sourced from the PubChem BioAssay database, can be downloaded from <http://chemmine.ucr.edu/bioassayr>. 
Advanced users can re-build this database from the raw data themselves, by using
the code provided on GitHub at <https://github.com/TylerBackman/pubchem-bioassay-database>.
This code is written for Linux systems, but a Dockerfile is included
to allow it to run on other platforms.
